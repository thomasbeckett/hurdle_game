## Development Problems
1. Moving mulitple of the same objects at once
 - I initially used classes to move the objects but when mulitple objects were on the page at the same time they would all appear in the same position
2. Removing objects
 - Initially used .hide() to make objects disappear but when a lot of time had passed there were lots of divs in the html which slowed down the page. Ended up using .remove() and .splice() to completely remove the div from the page
